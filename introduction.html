            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>

            <h2>History of AI</h2>
            <p>The concept of AI has been around for centuries, but it was not until the mid-20th century that the field began to take shape. In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the birth of AI as an academic discipline. Over the decades, AI has evolved through various phases, from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep learning.</p>
